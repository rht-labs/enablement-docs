### Retrospectives
#### _What are Retrospectives?_



### Retrospectives

Retrospectives are practice used by their teams to **reflect** on their way of working, and **continuously become better** in what they do. They are meant to help teams **keep improving.**

<!-- {_class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"} -->"*At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly*"

<!-- {_class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"} --> **- 12th Principle of the Agile Manifesto**



### Retrospectives
#### _Why use a Retrospective?_
- Improved productivity - *Helps teams to assess their situation and reduce waste*
- Improved capability - *Share knowledge and set goals for other team members to learn*
- Improved quality - *Writing better code means less rework and less bugs*
- Improved capacity - *Determine optimal solution for choosing features that add value. Being more productive, improving capability, and improving quality increases capacity*
- Improved camaraderie - *Provide a constructive environment for a good team dynamic*



### Retrospectives
#### _Retrospective Anti-patterns_
![Cry Emoji](images/cryemoji.png) <!-- {_class="inline-image"} -->

**Teams do not have them**

_So they never improve_

OR  

**Teams have them**

_But they are done poorly and teams do not follow up on identified items_



### Retrospectives
#### _Guidelines_
- Shorten the time between each one.
- Have ground rules for the session visible.
- Start with an update on the previous retrospective items.
- Focus discussions on what you are able to change.
- Always end on a high note.

### Retrospectives
_The Retrospective Prime Directive_

**"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone
did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and
abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."**

-Norm Kerth, Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Review



### Retrospectives
#### _The Retrospective Safety Check_

- Ask participants to choose a number between 1 and 5 that indicates how safe they feel within the group.
  - 5 - *No Problem, I’ll talk about anything*
  - 1 - *I’ll smile and be calm; everything is great and agree with the managers*
- The numbers should be taken anonymously.
- Acknowledge the result and decide what’s next...

### Information Radiators
#### _What is an Information Radiator?_



### Information Radiators
#### _An Information Radiator..._
- Involves radiating and visually representing all aspects of work.
- Typically means information that is useful to team members, stakeholders and users is physically presented on walls, windows, doors and other flat surfaces and positioned in the line of sight of those people who will get value from consuming the information.
- Enables the ability to "Walk the Walls", where someone interested in the work can walk around the physical space the associated team(s) are working from and get all the information they need from inspecting artefacts on the wall and from the resulting conversations.



### Information Radiators
#### _Why visualize work?_
- Facilitates a transparent and open way of working.
- Avoids hiding information about status, progress, direction, challenges and opportunities related to a project.
- Where important information is constantly accessible and visible to people, both speed and accuracy of their work can improve with reduced wastage from having to search for information.
- It is more likely that the information is accurate because people are continuously being reminded of it.
