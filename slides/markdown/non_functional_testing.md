## Non-Functional Testing



### Non-Functional Testing
#### _What Is It?_
Non-Functional Testing provides valuable insights into code quality, security, and
application performance. Non-functional tests can be automated and incorporated
into **continuous integration**.



### Non-Functional Testing
#### _How Does It Help?_
* Identify common code gotchas and pitfalls earlier
* Tighten the feedback loop by executing non-functional tests earlier in the
project lifecycle
* Improve code readability by following a coding standard
* Improve trust in the code quality
* Bring together security and development teams earlier
