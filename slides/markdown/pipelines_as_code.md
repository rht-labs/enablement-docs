## Pipelines As Code



### Pipelines As Code
#### _What Is It?_
A Jenkins pipeline can be defined with code in a **Jenkinsfile**.
* Based on the practice **everything as code**
* Allows Jenkins jobs and configurations to be configured as code, creating
automation around common tasks (no more point and click in Jenkins)
* Couples pipeline steps to exact commit, ensuring the ability to rebuild is there

## An Enslaved Hope



### Lab Exercise 4: An Enslaved Hope
The purpose of this lab is to replace the manually created Jenkins jobs from
Lab Exercise 2 with a source-controlled Jenkinsfile to automate pipeline
creation.



### What new tools and frameworks will we use?
* **Jenkinsfile**: a Jenkins pipeline can be described in this single file
* **Jenkins Slave**: provides a flexible way to add compute nodes with
specific configurations to a Jenkins instance
