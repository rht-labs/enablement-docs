### The Three Ways of DevOps

#### by Gene Kim, et. al.

### The Three Ways of DevOps
#### _The First Way: Systems Thinking_
The First Way emphasizes the performance of the entire system, as opposed to the performance of a specific silo of work or department. This can be as large as a division or as small as an individual contributor. <!-- {_class="medium para"} -->

_The DevOps Handbook_ <!-- {_class="small" style="text-align: right;"} -->



### The Three Ways of DevOps
#### _The Second Way: Amplify Feedback Loops_
* The Second Way is about creating more frequent feedback loops.

* The goal of almost any process improvement initiative is to shorten and amplify feedback loops so necessary corrections can be continually made.

* The outcomes of the Second Way include:
  * Understanding and responding to all customers, internal and external.
  * Shortening and amplifying all feedback loops
  * Embedding knowledge where we need it

### The Three Ways of DevOps
#### _The Third Way: Culture of Continual Experimentation and Learning_
* The Third Way is about creating a culture that fosters two things:
  * Continual experimentation, taking risks and learning from failure
  * Understanding that repetition and practice is the prerequisite to mastery

* Experimentation and taking risks are what ensures that we keep pushing to improve.

* The outcomes of the Third Way include:
  * Allocating time for the improvement of daily work
  * Creating rituals that reward the team for taking risks
  * Introducing faults into the system to increase resilience
