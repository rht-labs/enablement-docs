### Pair Programming
![Pair Programming](images/PairAndMob/coaching-coders-coding-7374.jpg) <!-- {_class="inline-image"} -->
**Pair programming** is a practice used in eXtreme Programming in which
two programmers work together at one computer.



### Mob Programming
![Mob Programming](images/PairAndMob/chairs-developer-development-1181376.jpg) <!-- {_class="inline-image"} -->
**Mob programming** is a software development approach where the whole team
works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same
computer.



### Exercise - Pairing and Mobbing
_Individual Drawing_

1. Everyone grab a small post-it.
2. Each person grab a different color pen.
3. Draw Public Figure on your own sticky note.



### Exercise - Pairing and Mobbing
_Pair Drawing_
1. Assemble in pairs.
2. Each pair grab a medium post-it
3. Take turns drawing an element of Public Figure.



### Exercise - Pairing and Mobbing
_Mob Drawing_
1. Assemble in table groups.
2. Each table use an easel post-it
3. Take turns drawing an element of Public Figure.



### Exercise - Takeaway

* Mobbing helps share expertise with entire teams
* Pairing helps deliver efficiently as knowledge grows
* Various situations demand different delivery approaches

## Configuration As Code



### Traditional Software Configuration
1. Manually install the operating system.
2. Manually install the software packages needed.
3. Modify the software configuration files by hand.
4. ...



### Configuration As Code
1. Select automated tools for provisioning and configuration.
   * Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc.
   * OpenStack, AWS CLI, Terraform, etc.
2. Write installation and configuration sequences as code.
3. Design configuration options as templates.
4. Check source configuration code into a source control repository.
5. Use the automated tools to apply your configs.



### Configuration As Code
#### _Benefits_
* Central authority for configuration
* Available through source control
  * Traceability
  * History and Diffs
* Configuration drift detection and correction
  * Prevents unwanted config changes
  * No more Snowflake servers
* Phoenix Server: burn it all to the ground and bring it back exactly the
way it was!



### Everything As Code
The practice of **Everything as Code** goes even further than configuration as code. All
manual steps should be scripted, automated, and checked into a source control
management system.

## The Manual Menace



### Lab Exercise 1: The Manual Menace
* This exercise is all about automation and **configuration-as-code**.
* This exercise is aimed at the creation of the supporting tooling that will be
used to support the rest of the exercises using code.
* The high level goal is to create a collection of project namespaces and
populate them with Git, Jenkins, and Nexus using code.
* As a learner, you will be able to:
  1. Run the [openshift-applier](https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-applier/)
  to automate creating cluster content.
  2. Create and administer project namespaces in OpenShift.
  3. Deploy commonly used applications to support the development process.

![OpenShift](images/PairAndMob/openshift.png)



### What new Tools and Frameworks will we use?
* **OpenShift Container Platform**: Red Hat's cloud application deployment and
hosting platform
* **GitLab**: Community-driven Git server now with integrated DevOps toolchain
* **Nexus**: Repository manager for storing lots of application types
  * Can host npm and container registries
* **Jenkins**: Open source build automation server that is highly customizable with plugins
* **Ansible**: Red Hat's IT automation tool used to provision and manage the
state of cloud and physical infrastructure
* **openshift-applier**: A set of Ansible playbooks/roles to apply OpenShift
objects to an OpenShift cluster
