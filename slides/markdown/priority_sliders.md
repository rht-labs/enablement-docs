## What are Priority Sliders?



### Priority Sliders are a visual tool for getting teams to agree which work items are the most important by trading one item against another on a scale from _least_ to _most_ important



### Effective Priority Sliders
![More important?](images/post-it-priority-sliders.png) <!-- {_class="fragment inline-image"} -->
- Used to validate what items should be done next when there are debates
- Publicly displayed
- A finite set of topics/dimensions/areas that can be relatively prioritized against each other



### Why use Priority Sliders?
- Enables an alignment and consensus on areas of focus
- Projects often involve trade offs, agreement is key
- Provides clarifications across stakeholder groups of motivations and desires



### Exercise - Priority Sliders
![Priority Sliders Example](images/example-priority-sliders.jpg) <!-- {_class="inline-image"} -->
#### In table groups, work together to:
  1. Draw a 5 heading priority slider chart
  2. Consider the  areas identified from Target Outcomes practice
  3. Discuss where you agree as a team the priorities, 1 to 5
  4. Note no priority can be the same level and trade-offs must occur.
