### Exercise - Team Formation
Form a straight line across the room in order of relative technical experience in development engineering practices.



## What is Team Identity?

- Creates culture
- Enables psychological safety
- Converts groups of individuals into high performing teams



## Examples of strong Team Identity

#### _Effective Social Contracts are:_
- Publicly displayed
- Revisited regularly and amended if required
-  Binding on *all* parties
- Signatories hold each other accountable



### Why use a Social Contract?
- Provide a quick means to clearly determine team dynamics and expectations
- Promote autonomy and self governing of team behavior
- Keep the team consciously aware of how they work together



### Social Contract examples:
![Example Social Contract](images/Example_Social_Contract.png) <!-- {_class="inline-image"} -->
- Core hours
- No blame culture
- Timebox debates
- Celebrate success!



### Exercise - Social Contract and Team Identity
![Post It](images/post-it.png) <!-- {_class="inline-image"} -->
1. In table groups, work together to:
  - Establish a team name
  - Talk about how you want to work together this week
  - Write your Social Contract
  - Record your team button
2. Think about any aspects of your Social Contract that are appropriate for the entire class so we can write the class Social Contract



<!--.slide: id="priority-sliders" -->
## What are Priority Sliders?



### Priority Sliders are a visual tool for getting teams to agree which work items are the most important by trading one item against another on a scale from _least_ to _most_ important



### Effective Priority Sliders
![More important?](images/post-it-priority-sliders.png) <!-- {_class="fragment inline-image"} -->
- Used to validate what items should be done next when there are debates
- Publicly displayed
- A finite set of topics/dimensions/areas that can be relatively prioritized against each other



### Why use Priority Sliders?
- Enables an alignment and consensus on areas of focus
- Projects often involve trade offs, agreement is key
- Provides clarifications across stakeholder groups of motivations and desires



### Exercise - Priority Sliders
![Priority Sliders Example](images/example-priority-sliders.jpg) <!-- {_class="inline-image"} -->
#### In table groups, work together to:
  1. Draw a 5 heading priority slider chart
  2. Consider the  areas identified from Target Outcomes practice
  3. Discuss where you agree as a team the priorities, 1 to 5
  4. Note no priority can be the same level and trade-offs must occur.
