## Learning Target Outcomes
_What are Target Outcomes?_



### Learning Target Outcomes
#### _Target Outcomes..._
- Are a tool to capture and articulate the goals and outcomes a team are striving to deliver.
- Can include customer (end user) based outcomes as well as business and capability based outcomes.
- Often harnesses and summarizes the findings and learnings from other Discovery practices into a finite set of statements that can be publicly displayed for team and stakeholders to regularly reference.



### Learning Target Outcomes
#### _What are **our** Target Outcomes?_
- Generate enthusiasm for DevOps culture and practices.
- Explore all principle practices used in everyday discovery and delivery.
- Have fun!
- _More?_



### Learning Target Outcomes
#### _What are **your** Target Outcomes?_
