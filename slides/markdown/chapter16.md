## Build Monitoring


### Build Monitoring
#### _What Is It?_
Build monitors allow the visualization of automated build processes.


### Build Monitoring
#### _How Does It Help?_
* Provides instant feedback to teams regarding the current status of the build
* Tightens the feedback loop by having vital information needed by teams available at all times
* Motivates teams to fix problems together

## Return of the Monitoring


### Lab Exercise 6: Return of the Monitoring
In this exercise we will be creating a build monitor to display all of our jobs
in one visual display as well as pipeline views. We will then add the cause of
build failures for each job to the monitors. This will allow you to rapidly
see why a particular build is failing and fix it faster.


### What new Tools and Frameworks will we use?
* **Build Monitor Plugin**: provides a highly visible view of the status of
selected Jenkins jobs.
* **Build Fail Analyzer**: analyzes the causes of failed builds and presents
the causes on the build page.
* **Pipeline Aggregator View**: allows the users to view the history of their
pipelines with stage information
