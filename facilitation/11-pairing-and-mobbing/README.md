# Pairing and Mobbing

> Session to introduce the practices of Mob Learning and Pair Programming, how we use them and show some examples mobbing and pairing in action. This will also include facilitating a short exercise to practice pairing and mobbing in a fun way! We use this session to strongly position pairing as a mechanism for the group completing the technical exercises of this Enablement. This is very important in achieving the target outcome of the Enablement and the Definition of Done.

## Slides

The latest version of slides for the session are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FQ16TPWh3IrSnG97baaE1Tace9XV7p0uu0MdQuOdMZ4/edit?usp=sharing)




## Facilitation Materials Needed

* Table groups of 4-6 people
* Monitors and keyboards - one per pair
* Sticky notes - one small square per person, one large (A5) per pair, one big flip-chart page per table
* Sharpie pens and markers
* Wall space to display drawings



## Facilitation Guidelines

* Present the slides to introduce Pairing and Mobbing, what they are, why we use them and show some examples. A YouTube video of Mob Programming is included in the deck and is useful to talk over as a group
* Present the residency examples provided in slides and encourage any Labs people present to talk about their experiences of using the practice
* Kick off [Pair Drawing exercise](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/pairdraw-2/) and, for fun, extend to Mob Draw.
* Provide strong direction to the class that we want everyone to pair (or mob in 3 if uneven table size) during all the exercises to get experience of these practices. Explain that this allows more techie people some time to practice their coaching and explanation skills (something we need to do regularly with business stakeholders in residencies) and allows the less techie people to get a little hands-on with these very important engineering practices. Based on experience of the initial Enablement sessions, this discussion and positioning is very important.
* If monitors have not yet been set up on the tables, now is a good time to bring them in and set them up.
