## Facilitation Materials Needed

* An open space for the whole group to form a large circle



## Facilitation Guidelines

* If time has permitted to produce a short summary video or a slide deck of photos from the 4 days, show that now (it's a great visual way to reflect and summarise the week)
* If not done already, get a group photo of everyone
* Present slides with summary of all the practices we've introduced during the four days
* Show the links to the material we have open sourced including:
    * Enablement Docs
    * Labs CI/CD
    * Open Practice Library
    * Labs Book Library
* Run the Confidence Voting retrospective as described in the Retrospectives facilitation guide
* Encourage final updates of the Real Time Retrospective and also mention a post Enablement survey will be issued
* Go round the circle for some final impact feedback from each participant
* Have a final ritual of high fives before closing



## Post Facilitation

* Photograph everything on walls, tables, boards, etc. and add to the media store that has hopefully grown during the week
* Send a wrap-up e-mail to everyone with links to repos, photos, videos shown, etc. Example [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ljFJxYId0Sj7_zzXuNSTjU_g5BVB9bOC7NQ-xltAouo)
* Issue a survey. Example [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pb-QuaGkcjsMji1H3RZ46VMXj3wAXBnuXH6lWYs7-u8) and encourage completion via e-mail, Slack, etc.
* After a week or so collate feedback responses into a summary. Example [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=114fYkT3Tk1a98jmfJLunQpaoZLogtGXRKCmK-2SIZX8)
* Consider further feedback in a few months to assess success against the original target outcomes.
* Add everyone to the the Alumni channel in Slack
