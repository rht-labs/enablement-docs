## Facilitation Materials Needed

* Teams in table size of 4 to 6
* Sticky Notes - set of the following on each table
    * Small Rectangular - lots of one color
* Sharpie Pens on each table
* Flip chart paper
* Flip chart pens
* Ping pong balls (100-150 in total for a group of 24)




## Facilitation Guidelines

* Present the slides to introduce Agile values, principles and pracitces
* This includes the 15 minute video by Henrik Kniberg, Product Ownership in a Nutshell. After playing this, a group discussion about what some of the memorable messages were
* Run the Ball game as decsribed on the slides:
    * 4 sprints in total
    * Radiate and capture estimates vs actuals
    * Look for trends in improved accuracy of estimation and increased overall velocity
* At the end of Sprint 2, suggest each team does a review of other teams to see if they can learn new techniques from watching others in action
* At the end of Sprint 3, calculate the team's overall velocity. Challenge them to triple this. Ask what would help bring up the overall velocity (answer is smaller teams). Run a 4th sprint where group can self organise into smaller teams (agree a team is more than one person)
* Debrief the learnings
