# Setting up the Enablement Session

> These notes are intended to evolve into a set of shared thoughts on how to set up and facilitate the Open Innovation Labs DevOps Culture and Practice Enablement.

_____


## Booking the space and facilities

Key requirements for the venue include:

* Desks in workshop format (5 tables of 4-5 people), ideally on wheels and movable (so we can go through the experience of teams configuring the space)
* Power socket banks for each table 
* LOTS of wall space (more than you could think.... we may need to supplement with "portable wall" boards) 
* Projector that supports HDMI
* Ability to play sound from laptop
* Strong WiFi (all delegates will need to be connected throughout the Enablement)
* At least one break out area - ideally a small room near the main room
* Pair programming - Monitors for the tables. One between two attendees (or mobs up to three).


## Shopping / Bring List

* Print Exercise Booklets - a PDF of all exercises. We have printed these in A4 color, double-sided with wire binding, a clear cover and black card back
* Card printouts of "The Big Picture" components
* Poster printouts of
    * Henrik Kniberg Product Ownership in a Nutshell
    * Henrik Kniberg Skateboard Picture
    * The Agile Manifesto Values and Principles
    * What DevOps is Not
    * The Agile Principles cartoon from Knowledge Train
* Some spare adapters for overseas' participants to connect laptops to power    
* Bluetac
* A1 Sticky Chart Paper
* Boards (especially if wall space is lacking)
* Post-it / sticky notes (variety of colors and sizes as described in the Facilitation Guides)
* Sharpies (enough for one per participant + a few extra)
* Whiteboard Pens - mixture of colors
* Magic Whiteboard (especially if there is a lack of whiteboard space in the venue)
* Painters' Tape - mixture of colors
* Bluetooth Speaker
* Fun activities (e.g. a mini golf set and mini ping pong set)
* Option to project build monitors (e.g. through Rasperry Pis) - organise extra monitors or bring projector
* Think about capturing the Enablement by bringing, for example, GoPro Camera, 360 cameera, etc.
* Monitors for pairing if not provided by the venue
* Download all videos used in the training incase of WiFi connectivity issues 
* Order some Swag from Marketing - great for everyone to take something away and it also provides an opportunity to boost Team Identity and get a great photo with everyone in, for example, their new t-shirt!


## Setting up the Room

The day before the Enablement begins, get access to the room and lay out all materials. Specific things to set up include:
* Backlog
* Burndown
* Definition of Done
* Target Outcomes
* Realtime Retrospective
* Big Picture Area
* Practice Corner Area
* Ping Pong and Golf
* Labs isâ€¦.
* Space for Faces
* Space for Animals
* End of Day 2 Retrospective canvas (one for each table group)
* End of Day 3 Retrospective canvas (one for the whole group)
* A location for catering to be delivered to and consumed from
We strongly recommend using the full day before the Enablement to set the room up as you expect it to be used during the 4 days (including putting up all the "Big Picture" and "Practice Corner" as you expect it to be on day 4). Not only does this help familiarise further with the material but it will also test the space considerations.
We then "re-set" the space to start the Enablement with just a circle of chairs. This facilitates a great collaborative start and also provide the opportunities for the newly formed teams to configure their space themselves.


Think about the wall space that will be used for:
* Team's Social Contract
* Wider Group Social Contract
* Event Storming
* Metric Based Process Maps
* Value Slicing
* End of Day Retros
* Pairing and mob faces
* Andon Chord or Real Bell / Buzzer if available
* The example linkage for ToDoIst: Impact Map -> Event Storm -> Value Slices -> Initial Product Backlog -> Sprint 1 Board (done) -> Updated Product Backlog -> Sprint 2 Board (which is the focus on Exercise 3)


## Facilitation Guidelines

* Facilitation Guides have been prepared for each of the exercises (technical and non-technical). These are intended to be living and breathing documents which will be updated as more Enablement sessions are run.
* Slideware includes lots of real world residency examples of practices being taught. It is expected that these examples will change session-by-session and the Labs facilitators will inject their own stories, photos and videos in here.
* Catering is an important factor to consider. Having group breakfasts and lunch emulates what we do on Residencies and provides additional time to bond, network, form teams, relax and have fun / chill-out time
* Having a group social during the week is also an important aspect of the Enablement and representative of what we try to do during Residencies. Provides similar impact to point above and helps drive team culture.
* It is strongly recommended to plan for classes of up to 24 people. This will require an "overall facilitator" (to focus on opening / closing the workshop and each day) and one "technical facilitator" (people who can trouble-shoot technical issues and are very familiar with the technical exercises) for every 12 participants. So, a full group of 24 participants would need 1 overall facilitator and 2 technical facilitators. The facilitation of this is intense and demanding and required 100% focus during the week.
* For growing the facilitation pool, we strongly recommend a three stage approach
    * Attend and complete the Enablement in full as a participant
    * Attend a subsequent Enablement again but shadow the Facilitator team with some opportunities to present
    * Be a primary facilitator on a subsequent Enablement
* Each day should include a "walk the walls" exercise to introduce and re-visit 1) The Product Backlog/Burndwon; 2) The Big Picture; and 3) The Practice Corner. We often start each morning with this and allow as much time as possible for discussion, questions and to kick-start the day with collaboration
* We like to include a thought-inspiring YouTube video each day. They are nice to play first thing (before the Walk the Walls) as people come in and are having coffee. Equally, they are good to be used as time dividers, breaking up long exercises, just after lunch, etc.  Videos that have beeen used to date include:
    * [Henrik Kniberg's Product Ownership in a Nutshell](https://youtu.be/502ILHjX9EE)
    * [Drive: The surprising truth about what motivates us](https://youtu.be/u6XAPnuFjJc)
    * [Django explaining DevOps in a Bath](https://youtu.be/Qj09XRhp0lA)
    * ["Greatness" by David Marquet](https://youtu.be/OqmdLcyES_Q)
* We like to play some fun games / energisers during the four days. It helps drive fun and team culture as well as keep enegery levels up (especially useful during the longer technical exercises). Activities we have used include:
    * [Human Rock Paper Scissors](http://www.funretrospectives.com/human-rock-paper-scissors/)
    * [Collaborative Face Drawing](http://www.funretrospectives.com/collaborative-face-drawing/)
    * [Context Switching Game](http://personalkanban.com/pk/expert/context-switching-why-limit-your-wip-iv/)
* Add a channel to the [Enablement Slack Group](labsenablement.slack.com) specifically for your session and add all participants and facilitators. This is great for promoting discussion before, during and after the workshop.
