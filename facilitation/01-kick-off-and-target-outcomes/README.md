## Facilitation Materials Needed

* Start session with the whole group in a big circle
* Group should be near the information radiators used during the session (Backlog, Big Picture, Realtime reto, etc.)
* Sticky Notes - one large (A5) sticky note on each chair (for Faces) and one smaller rectangular sticky note (for Animals) on each chair. One small square Red sticky and one small square Green sticky (for mood marbles) on each chair
* Sharpie Pens - one on each chair



## Facilitation Guidelines

* Play the [Collaborative Face Drawaing](http://www.funretrospectives.com/collaborative-face-drawing/) energizer
* Present slides which sign posts to all the introductions to make
* Showcase of the room to point to the visual artefacts to be used as a part of running the session (sign posted in slides)
* When introducing the Backlog for the 4 days, it's important to note that we almost certainly will not do everything on the backlog. We will also embrace feedback and change and may well add, remove, update, re-order the items on it. This is an important lesson that Backlogs never get done completely!
* Round the room for everyone to introduce themselve
