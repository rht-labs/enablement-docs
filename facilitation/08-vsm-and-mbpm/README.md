# Value Stream Mapping and Metric Based Process Mapping

> Session to introduce the practices of Value Stream Mapping and Metric Based Process Mapping, how we use the and show some examples of real Metrics Based Process Map artefacts. This will also include a short interactive exercise to practice MBPM.

## Facilitation Materials Needed

* Pennies or poker chips (20 for each table)
* Flipchart paper - one piece for each table
* Marker pens
* Teams in table size of 4 to 6
* Sticky Notes - set of the following on each table
    * Small Rectangular - lots of one color
* Sharpie Pens (1 per person) on each table
* Single color Painters' Tape
* Lots of board / wall space to fit 2 large MBPMs (with 12 people collaborating around)


## Facilitation Guidelines

* Play the [Penny Flow game](https://www.leanagiletraining.com/better-agile/agile-penny-game-rules/) to introduce the notion of capturing metrics around flow (and the impact batch size has).
* Present the slides to introduce Value Stream Mapping and Metrics Based Process Mapping, what they are and why we use them. Show some real world examples and talk through the MBPM before and after as well as the roll-up of metric improvements.
* Optiopnnaly, run a further interactive exercise (with the addition of the Penny Flow Game and the feedback before and after including this, this exercise is less valuable):
    * In pairs, capture all business processes between the trigger of the business requesting a feature and the outcome of that feature running in production and being used
    * In groups of 12, combine all processes onto a single map
    * Add some metrics based on traditional software development (with minimal automation) - Process Time, Lead TIme, CAC%
    * Facilitate a playback of each MBPM and start discussing about activities or practices that may help drive improvements
