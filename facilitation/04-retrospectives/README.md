## Facilitation Materials Needed

Different retrospectives will need different materials:
* A 'round the circle' impact feedback session should have an object (e.g. small football) to throw around the room (whoever has the object is the speaker)
* The stop/start/continue format requires sticky notes (ideally different colors), sharpie pens and flip-chart or magic whiteboard paper to radiate the output
* The timeline and real-time retrospectives require sticky tape to create the timeline and the same materials as stop/start/continue format



## Facilitation Guidelines

* Before the session starts, set up a time line retrospective in a visible and accessible space in the learning facility.
    * Draw a long line that represents the 4 day time line
    * Mark a + and a - above and below the line
    * Make sticky notes and sharpies available near the timeline
    * Introduce the real-time retrospective early on the first day and encourage people to add to it as and when they experience something positive or negative or would like to feedback something positive or negative 
* Each day should also finish with a retrospective. It's up the the facilitators to use whatever exercise they would like to. It is recommended to try some different flavors rather than finish with exactly the same exercise each day. Some examples include:
    * Day 1 - a round the group impact feedback (say one thing that impacted you. Pass the ball; you can only talk if you have the ball. 
    * Day 2 - Individual table retros. Allow teams to feedback against each other's committment to the social contract. Use a  stop/start/continue retro to facilitate the conversation. Collect Key points onto group wide retro board.
    * Day 3 - a do more of / do less of / continue / stop / start retro
    * Day 4 - a fist of 5 confidence vote. Facilitator should ask how confident everyone is in jointly delivering and upcoming Labs residency (as per the target outcome of this Enablement). Everyone should simultaneously announce a score of 0-5 using fingers. The same question can be asked as to how much everyone would like to participate in a Labs residency.
* Each retrospective should be introduced by one of the facilitators, have a time boxed period for individuals to add their input and a group alignment / discuss to identify clusters / themes and corrective actions
