# Rogue Cluster

> This section contains information needed when setting up the cluster, and a command line cheat sheet to help with completing exercises.

---

## Cluster Requirements

Learners will create 3 to 4 project namespaces running lightweight NodeJS app \* 2 and a MongoDB in up to three of these namespace (dev, test, uat for example). The learners ci-cd namespace will house GitLab, Nexus and Jenkins as well as any slave pods used by Jenkins.

- Jenkins requires 5Gi of Persistent Storage and 4Gi of RAM
- GitLab requires 2Gi of storage and 2Gi of RAM
- PostgreSQL requires 1Gi of Storage and 512Mi of RAM
- Redis requires 512Mi of storage
- Nexus requires 1Gi of storage.

## Cluster Access

- Learners are in LDAP and can access cluster via `oc login`
- Learners have access to LDAP bind credentials to be able to auth against GitLab

## User privileges

- Learners deploying GitLab will require privileges to run SCC containers

## Labs Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet will give you some of the most useful commands and tips which you will need to complete the exercises. This should be most helpful to non-techies who need to get up to speed with command line techniques. If you come across anything else which would be useful during the enablement, write it on a post-it and add it to the real time retro or raise a pull request.

- Changing Directory

  - `cd dir_name` Changes directory to `dir_name` within your current working directory
  - `cd /path/to/dir` Changes to the absolute location specified
  - `cd ..` Changes to the parent directory
  - `cd -` Changes to the previous diretory

- Creating a blank file or directory

  - `touch file_name` Creates a blank file named `file_name` within the current directory
  - `mkdir dir_name` Creates a new directory named `dir_name` within the current directory

- Listing files within current directory

  - `ls` prints a list of the files within your current directory
  - `ls -l` prints a list of the files within your current directory with more detail

- Quickly see the contents of a file

  - `cat file_name` prints the contents of `file_name` to the console

- Move or rename a file

  - `mv file_name dest_dir` will move the file from the current directory to `dest_dir`
  - `mv file_name new_name` will rename the file to `new_name`

- Open a file

  - `open file_name` will open the file as though it had been double clicked in a standard user interface

- Copy a file or directory

  - `cp file_name dest_dir` will create a copy of the file in the destination directory
  - `cp file_name copied_name` will create a copy of the file in the same directory and it shall be called `copied_name`
  - `cp -r dir_name dest_dir` will copy a directory to the destination location. Note the `-r` flag is necessary to copy the contents of the directory

- Delete a file or directory

  - `rm file_name` will delete the file
  - `rm -rf dir_name` will delete the directory and all of its contents
  - Whatever you do, _do not_ run `sudo rm -rf /`

- Search for a string within an input

  - `grep 'substring' file_name` will print all lines in the file which contain the string 'substring'

- Place the output of one command into the input of another

  - `command1 | command2` will run command 1 then run command 2 with the input of the result of command 1. e.g. `ls | grep 'file'` will give you all files in the current directory which have 'file' in their name

- Find out how to do things in the terminal

  - `man command1` will open the man pages (manual pages) for a particular command.
  - `man -k <search string>` will return a list of commands relevant to the search string you've entered.
  - If you want to know more about `man` try `man man` for more `man` on `man` information.

- Run commands with root privileges
  - `sudo command1` will run a command with escalated privileges. This is safer than logging on as root user.

## Openshift 101

OpenShift, or OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) is Red Hat's container platform. It is used to run and manage containerised applications with the aim of accelerated application development and deployment. We shall be deploying all of our applications for this enablement on an OpenShift cluster.

- What is a container?

  - A container is an isolated space within the operating system which is made to look like its own computer. Things within the container can only see what is in itself and cannot see anything about the computer it is really running on. Additionally multiple containers can be deployed with no interaction between one another meaning they will not coflict.

- How do you control OpenShift?
  - There are two main ways of controlling OpenShift and the containers which reside within it. The first way is using the web interface; from here is it possible to use clicks to deploy an application. The easiest way to do this is direct from the source code using a Source-to-image (S2I) which comes out of the box with OpenShift. It is also possible (and encouraged) to use the command line interface, using the `oc` command, to control OCP. The other option is to use Ansible to set the cluster to a defined standard, as set out in an Ansible playbook.

## Ansible 101

Ansible is a tool which automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment.

- How to run an Ansible playbook
  - `ansible-playbook file.yml -i inventory_dir/` will run the Ansible playbook defined in file.yml (playbooks are defined in YAML format). The inventory directory will contain all of the information about what will be deployed. In the enablement we will use Ansible extensively, but the structure will be given to you to make this easier.
