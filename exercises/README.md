![jenkins-crio-ocp-star-wars-kubes](./images/jenkins-crio-ocp-star-wars-kubes.png)

This is a collection of practices and exercises to take a learner through a four day simulated residency experience. Learners can expect to be exposed to labs practices such as [Event Storming](https://rht-labs.github.io/practice-library/practices/event-storming/), [Social Contract](https://rht-labs.github.io/practice-library/practices/social-contract/) and [Impact Mapping](https://rht-labs.github.io/practice-library/practices/impact-mapping/) among many more which can be found in our [Practice Library](https://rht-labs.github.io/practice-library/). Learners will also be exposed to `Labs CI/CD` - how we use OpenShift & Ansible in conjunction with Jenkins to automate build and deploy of a sample todolist application and its required infrastructure.

## Learner Outcomes
1. Prepare participants to *jointly* deliver on upcoming Labs Residencies - specifically: senior consultants, architects, and agile PMs
2. Explore all principle practices used in a residency through a hands on real life experience
3. Enable countries and regions to run the session independently
